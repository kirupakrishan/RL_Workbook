# Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains implementations and experiments in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
The aim of this project is to explore and compare different RL algorithms across simulation environments, with a focus on understanding their performance, stability, and adaptability.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Modular RL framework for training and evaluation
- Implemented algorithms:
  - Deep Q-Network (DQN)
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  - Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
- Configurable training pipeline (via YAML/JSON)
- Support for logging, plotting, and checkpointing
- Integration with **OpenAI Gym** and custom environments
